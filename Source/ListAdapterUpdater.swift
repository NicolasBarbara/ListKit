/**
 An `ListAdapterUpdater` is a concrete type that conforms to `ListUpdatingDelegate`.
 It is an out-of-box updater for `ListAdapter` objects to use.
 
 - Note: This updater performs re-entrant, coalesced updating for a list. It also uses a least-minimal diff
 for calculating UI updates when `ListAdapter` calls
 `performUpdateWith(collectionView:fromObjects:toObjects:completion:)`.
