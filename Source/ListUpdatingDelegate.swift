     Tells the delegate to perform a section transition from an old array of objects to a new one.
     - Parameters:
        - collectionViewBlock: A block returning the collecion view to perform updates on.
        - fromObjects: The previous objects in the collection view. Objects must conform to `ListDiffable`.
        - toObjectsBlock: A block returning the new objects in the collection view. Objects must conform to `ListDiffable`.
        - animated: A flag indicating if the transition should be animated.
        - objectTransitionBlock: A block that must be called when the adapter applies changes to the collection view.
        - completion: A completion block to execute when the update is finished.
     
     - Note: Implementations determine how to transition between objects. You can perform a diff on the objects, reload
     each section, or simply call `reloadData()` on the collection view. In the end, the collection view must be setup with a
     section for each object in the `toObjects` array.
     
     The `objectTransitionBlock` block should be called prior to making any `UICollectionView` updates, passing in the `toObjects`
     that the updater is applying.
